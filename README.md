# Engineering-Support-Bot
A discord bot for the unofficial but kinda official UWO engineering server ðŸ˜‰


The primary functionally is for providing students with easy to access weekly task lists to help the engineering community keep on track through the rigors of the semester. The task list is read from a shared Google sheets file so that collaborators can easily update the weekly schedule on the fly. This means that no programming or technical knowledge is required on behalf of the contributors. 

## Main Features

### Weekly Schedule 
By reading from the Google Docs API, the bot checks each weeks listed tasks, and sends them weekly to the server every monday. 
We can set the width and height using absolute values, as follows:

### On the fly class task list
By entering a command "!course-name" the bot outputs the tasklist for any given course in the system.

### Financial Advice
All students have been faced with the age old problem. Is spending x amount of money worth it? Fortunately Support Bot can easily answer that question by telling you how many McChickens you could by for any given amount of money.
